    "cancel": {
      "question": "What happens if I cancel my subscription?",
      "answer": "You can cancel your subscription at any time from your dashboard. Your access remains active until the end of the paid period (month or year). No refund is made for already paid periods, but you retain full access until your subscription expires. You can reactivate your subscription at any time."

    "vat": {
      "question": "Do prices include VAT?",
      "answer": "Displayed prices are excluding tax (HT). VAT will be added at checkout according to your geographic location. For European businesses with a valid EU VAT number, VAT is reverse-charge (you self-assess the VAT). Contact us for more information on billing for your country."
    },
    "discounts": {
      "question": "Do you offer discounts for startups or NGOs?",

      "question": "How can I pay for my subscription?",
      "answer": "We accept credit card payments (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) and bank transfers for annual and Enterprise subscriptions. Payments are secured via Stripe (PCI-DSS certified). For Enterprise plans, we also offer custom billing options with negotiable payment terms."
